<p><font size="5">General FAQ&#39;s</font></p>
<ol>
	<li><b>What is the advantage of using Advanced FTP Server over other ftp servers?</b><br>
	Other free FTP servers dose not provide the facility to control the server remotely 
	and some provides this facility by installing the required software&#39;s in the 
	remote machine which may not be possible all the times. But this provides a simple, 
	user friendly web interface, where you can connect from remote machine through 
	a browser. This enables control over the application from remote machines.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>When the HTTP port is changed it shown the message box that it had been 
	changed but then the page is not displayed properly?</b><br>
	When the HTTP port is changed the application starts running the server with 
	the new port where the previous port you were using becomes invalid. Once you 
	change the HTTP port you also need to manually change the port in the address 
	bar. Here even when the HTTP port is changed the server retains your authentication 
	information till you close the browser and when you change the port and reconnect 
	you need not re-authenticate.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>How to change the HTTP User Name and Password via browser?</b><br>
	Navigate to Service Settings and just type in the user name and password in 
	the field provided and click the Save Changes button.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Why the web interface so simple and classic?</b><br>
	This simple interface is provided to maintain the speed and reduce the band 
	width of the server. More over just to maintain the server no rich appearance 
	is required.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>What is the use of running the application as windows service?</b><br>
	As this application is run from windows service this starts as soon as the windows 
	started. So to use the ftp server remotely you need not login to your windows 
	account. When you require any files from your system when you are outside, you 
	can call up some body and ask to turn on your system so that you can use your 
	IP Address to connect to your system.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>How to connect to the ftp server when the port no is changed from 21 
	to some thing else?</b><br>
	The default global port for FTP server is 21 and your client always connects 
	to the ftp server using the port 21 until you explicitly define the port. To 
	explicitly define the port just type in like this ftp://IPAddress:Port no. (E.g. 
	ftp://121.0.0.1:25) will connect to the local ftp server running in port 25.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Is their any way to directly connect to the http server without explicitly 
	mentioning the http port?</b><br>
	Yes, the global default port for the http server is 80. If you change the http 
	port to 80 then you need not mention the http port explicitly. (Note: Only one 
	application can run in one single port. So if you change the port to 80 any 
	other http applications installed, like IIS wont work properly)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>When the ftp port no is set to 21 it was not working properly but it 
	works with some other ports?</b><br>
	This means the port 21 is used by some other applications and so you cannot 
	use the port 21. It must be some other ftp applications. Either you must stop 
	the other application from using this port or you need to use some other port 
	for this application.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>The ftp server is working properly in the system where it is installed 
	but when connecting from remote machines it is not connecting?</b><br>
	Their may be several cause for this problem like firewall blocks the program 
	from for external connections, your router may not forward the ports to your 
	system, your external IP address is different from the IP address in your local 
	network (LAN), when you connect to the server from remote machine not in your 
	local network (LAN) you need to use your external IP. You can easily find reference 
	in google to solve your problem.</li>
